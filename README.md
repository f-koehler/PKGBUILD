pkgbuilds
=========
Some stuff at the AUR has become outdated and sometimes I also feel like adding new packages. In the future I will put all my PKGBUILDs in this repo:

  | pkgname | AUR                                                   | state            |

  |testu01  | [link](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/testu01/)   |:white_check_mark:|
